      summary: Replace Music Section
      deprecated: false
      description: >-
        > Replace a specific time segment within existing music.


        This interface can replace specific time segments in already generated
        music. It requires providing the original music's task ID and the time
        range to be replaced. The replaced audio will naturally blend with the
        original music.


        ## Parameter Details


        ### Required Parameters


        *   `taskId`: Original music's parent task ID

        *   `audioId`: Audio ID to replace

        *   `prompt`: Prompt describing the replacement segment content

        *   `tags`: Music style tags

        *   `title`: Music title

        *   `infillStartS`: Start time point for replacement (seconds, 2 decimal
        places)

        *   `infillEndS`: End time point for replacement (seconds, 2 decimal
        places)


        ### Optional Parameters


        *   `negativeTags`: Music styles to exclude

        *   `fullLyrics`: Complete lyrics after modification, combining both
        modified and unmodified lyrics

        *   `callBackUrl`: Callback address after task completion


        ## Time Range Instructions


        *   `infillStartS` must be less than `infillEndS`.

        *   Time values are precise to 2 decimal places, e.g., `10.50` seconds.

        *   The replacement time range must be between **6 and 60 seconds**.

        *   Replacement duration should not exceed **50%** of the original
        music's total duration.


        ## Developer Notes


        *   Replacement segments will be regenerated based on the provided
        `prompt` and `tags`.

        *   Generated replacement segments will automatically blend with the
        original music's preceding and following parts.

        *   Generated files will be retained for **14 days**.

        *   Query task status using the same interface as generating music: [Get
        Music Details](/suno-api/get-music-details).

                    Callback URL for task completion. The system will send a
                    POST request to this URL when replacement is complete,
                    containing task status and results.


                    - Your callback endpoint should be able to accept POST
                    requests containing JSON payloads with replacement results

                    - For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see
                    [Replace Music Section
                    Callbacks](https://docs.kie.ai/suno-api/replace-section-callbacks)

                    - Alternatively, you can use the get music details interface
                    to poll task status
