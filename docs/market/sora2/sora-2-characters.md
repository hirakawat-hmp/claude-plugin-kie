        advanced AI model


        ## File Upload Requirements


        Before using the Character Animation API, you need to upload your
        character videos:


        ### Step 1: Upload Character Videos


        Visit our [File Upload API](/file-upload-api/upload-file-url) to upload
        your character videos.


        **Requirements:**

        - **File Type**: MP4, WebM, or AVI format

        - **Duration**: Between 1-4 seconds per video

        - **Max File Size**: 10MB per file

        - **Content**: Character movements or actions you want to animate


        Only one character video can be uploaded per animation task.


        ### Step 2: Get Upload URLs


        After successful upload, you'll receive file URLs that can be used in
        the `character_file_url` parameter.


        ### Step 3: Submit Animation Task


        Use the obtained URLs in your API request to generate character
        animations with the new parameters.


        ## Additional Parameters


        Besides the character video URL, you can provide additional parameters
        to enhance your character animation:


        - **`character_prompt`**: Description of the character and desired
        animation style (Max 5000 characters)

        - **`safety_instruction`**: Safety guidelines and content restrictions
        for the animation (Max 5000 characters)


        Both parameters are optional but recommended for better control over the
        animation output.


        :::warning[File Storage Notice:]

        Files uploaded through our File Upload API are stored temporarily for
        only 14 days. After this period, the character URLs will become invalid
        and cause errors when using the Character Animation API. We recommend
        using third-party permanent storage solutions (such as AWS S3, Google
        Cloud Storage, or other cloud storage services) to ensure long-term
        availability of your character video files.

        :::


        ::: tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

        :::


        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check
        progress and retrieve results:

        href="/market/common/get-task-detail">
           Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
        </Card>


        ### Task Query Response Format


        When the task is completed successfully (`state: "success"`), the
        `resultJson` field contains:

        ```

        {
          "character_id": "example_123456789"
        }

        ```


        :::tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the callBackUrl parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status
